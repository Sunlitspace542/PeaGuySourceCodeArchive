Date: Late 2004 (Pea-Guy Era)

Plot:
Pea-Guy has disappeared.  While he's actually been kidnapped by Kan and taken to Pagoon, those he used to protect believe that he's abandoned them and left them at Kan's mercy.  While unsuccessful, Pea-Gal's attack on Ultimenein's fortress has inspired Pea-Guy's former student, "Little" Green Pea, to action.  Green Pea has gathered 3 more warriors to help him, Don Piea Bleebos from the southern land of Mecksacka, fellow Pea-Guy student Murdie and one more former friend of Pea-Guy's.  With their troop together they arm themselves with the best equipment available and attack Pacula's Castle!  Note that even if you "beat" this game, Pacula still appears at the end and your character is doomed.

Gameplay:
Not well decided.  Probably similar to Pacula's Curse but with different types of weapons and emphasis on larger, more open areas rather than small mazes.
