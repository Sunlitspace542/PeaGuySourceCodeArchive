Run mainmenu.exe to play/install the games on R.I.Pea-Guy.  In addition to the menu I've included several extra bonuses befitting a "Director's Cut" type CD like this one.  Enjoy!

PeaGuyCheatCodes.txt
Here you'll find a list of every cheat code and hidden thing in a previous Pea-Guy game that I can think of, except for this CD.  Still need to keep SOMETHING a secret!

SourceCode
This directory contains source code for several games on this CD, as well as a couple of image libraries from the never-made game "Bashtallica".  Note; this is not "open source" or "free source", please read the "ReadMeNow.txt" file for complete license information.

FunJunk
This directory, like many a directory before it on Pac-Guy/Pea-Guy CDs, just contains random junk for you to have fun with.

mpfull.exe
If "Pacula's Curse" or "Pac-Guy Ultimeneinasenshun" crash or encounter errors when you try to run them, install this file.

sock.exe
Possibly the most pointless executable I've ever made.  Right-click to quit.  Do not press the "any key".
