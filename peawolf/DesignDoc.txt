PEA-GUY in A-Shock-Ellips-Now!
______________________________

The Story so far:
I'm not sure about the story. Basically the gameplay does not
depend on the story, so it could be changed. But for now, a kinda
nasty lord stolen the Pea-guy's sun glasses thinking they were
magical. Pea-Guy now must go to the lord's castle to get his
sunglasses.

The Environment:
Indoor (castle) and outdoor(gardens), but mainly it will look
kinda Wolfeinstein3d-ish. The view can be first-person or third-person.

The Gameplay:
Like in VorB, Pea-Guy must turn on switches to open the door and exit
to the next level, killing or dodging enemies when needed.



Comments:
As I don't have a strong story, i'd like to know what are the games
before and after mine about so I could link those situations
with my storyline.

I mainly worked on the programming and the gameplay, so the art
will be better.

If I have some extra time I will make my own collision system
(meaning faster frame-rate). And I could also add a lightmap
(meaning a frame-rate drop).

On the gameplay side I will add some pick-ups, like lives, speed boost,
extra dammager, invisibility, invincibility, any other ideas are welcome.
There will also be things like lava pool, moving blocks, etc.
I don't think to add any extra weapon, to avoid turning it into a shooter.
