This is my discription of this game to the public. Astral Entertainment can either make up their own,
	or use mine (or add to or edit mine).

This is a Pea-Guy game with six scrolling levels (four regular levels and two boss levels), 
	where you can either play as Pea-Guy, or a new character, La Shae. La Shae's planet is 
	being overrun by evil spiders and octopusses, and it must be saved. This game has
	earthquakes on level 4.
